# In theory, this means that we could reproduce the number after
# it has been generated by using the correct timestamp as the seed
# and then by checking until we find i such that random.random()
# is the same as the generated number
# this also means that we cannot predict what the correct number
# would be in advance by just knowing the timestamp
